        <p><h3>"Teamers"</h3><h4>2022/03/27</h4><img src="imgs/fun-teamers.png" alt="Image" /><br>Soccer mode(now removed) in arras.io. Some players in the Green team used the same tank, played until every teammate died, and respawned with another tank...<br>Blue team's nightmare when they switched to Penta Shots. lol<br>The Penta Shots got killed by overseers(they cannot use 1 tank in 2 runs), and when Green players were staying in the base and clicking skill points, Blue trappers scored several goals and won the game. :(<br>I quitted arras.io in January 2023. It was an awesome game.</p>
        <br>
        <p><h3>"Singleplayer game"</h3><h4>2022/07/21</h4><img src="imgs/fun-solo.jpg" alt="Image" /><br>Wave mode(now removed) in florr.io. Trying solo game with 5 Epic petals(not wheel-of-death build).<br>In this run i got my first Legendary petal(Faster) and collected 2 more(Web & Pincer) in the next two weeks.<br>My first florr.io account has been deleted(not banned) in August. In February 2023 I created a new one and got level 90, 8 slots with full Legendaries in less than a week...<br>Good f*kin' job M28. I'm away from this game now.</p>
